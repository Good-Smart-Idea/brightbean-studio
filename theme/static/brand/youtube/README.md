# Official YouTube icons

Downloaded on 2026-10-13 from the official [YouTube icon page](https://brand.youtube/youtube-icon/)
and its [asset archive](https://www.gstatic.com/marketing-cms/78/29/3e68a1414bb28d0b7e47b44c3c91/youtube-icon.zip).
These three PNGs are unchanged archive assets; they are not traced or recoloured.

| Local file | Archive asset | SHA-256 |
|---|---|---|
| icon-red.png | Red icon on transparent canvas | 1027b1b0517727adb9697155a270744381c3ce9b047b1c8bd8a9389dc7d07a83 |
| icon-black.png | Black icon on transparent canvas | b3d0f71c6d094af85651f918e69a66210dbcee23e5382511935b5ab9ca47b266 |
| icon-white.png | White icon on transparent canvas | fb0593aaafa8ee8e01e1f5782b3b45b584ec82eaaae5982781572cec0c828f3c |

The official red icon is rendered by `templates/partials/_youtube_icon.html`
on the connect-platform card, public client-onboarding row and account-selection
header. The unchanged PNG preserves its intrinsic clear space and proportions,
renders on white, and links to YouTube. At the user's request, the original compact
layout is restored: a 20px visible icon width in the platform card and onboarding
row, and 24px in the account-selection header. Image canvas heights are 26px and
31.2px respectively, preserving the supplied proportions and clear space.

`templates/partials/_youtube_attribution.html` renders the plain trade name
“YouTube” in the application's normal font, linking to the corresponding channel
or video. The sidebar shows YouTube above the channel name beside its avatar.
Mixed-platform content identifies its source within each YouTube block. Text
attribution does not reproduce the graphic wordmark or imply endorsement.

The compact graphics fall below the previously selected 100px minimum visible
height; this implementation does not claim that minimum is satisfied. The PNG
canvas is 1255 × 1075; the visible mark occupies 827 × 579 pixels. A 26px-high
canvas gives a 20px-wide visible mark; 31.2px gives a 24px-wide visible mark.
Preserve proportions, clear space and
approved solid backgrounds; do not recolour the asset or apply opacity effects.
The numeric graphic minimum does not specify a minimum font size for plain text.
Reviewer acceptance of the overall remediation remains pending.
